# matplotlib-challenge

Module 5 challenge had us working with matplotlib to look at data from Pymaceuticals Inc. This company was working wtih some anti-cancer medications, and were doing some testing on mice. We were asked to compare information for a promising drug - Capomulin.

For this challenge, it had us pull information from 2 different csv files. We were then asked to create saome summary stats, number of mice, taking out duplicate data, determining  the mean, median, and standard deviation. We worked to crate quartiles, and outliers. Creating the correlation and regrsission line also helped to interpret the data. Displayed the data in bar, line, pie, scatter, and blox plot graphs.

This challenge had us doing many of the items we have been practicing, while adding in some charts/graphs to help visualize the data. Have the tools to create graphs to utilize for reports while be a key skill for me. As I currently take data, and export into excel to make the charts to put into PowerPoint presentaiton for my leaders to use when giving presentaitons. 

I still struggle with mixing code betwen pandas and pyplot, along wtih when to use {}, [], and (). Once of these days, I will figure that out, so I don't write the code, and then work through all of the error types. And to be honest, some of my biggest challenges, is correct spelling.  It is more difficult to type in some of the boxes, without autocorrect helping you out on your freehand typing.
